Groups are formed under these topics, and each group is assigned a different task or sub-topic by the group creator. When a user enters the \"Tree\", options like entering a group, or seeing other groups' activities or uploads are possible. It also features a scheduler that helps the group to organize their time and changes its color when the work is done. In order to achieve the best user experience, we have designed an easily-accessible and organized layout for the app. The best option for the user interface design was chosen to be Material Design by Google, for its simplicity and modern form. In this readme, we first start with the presentation of the general user interface features of the design, starting with the main facilities' designs, then continuing with more detailed analysis of specific components that make the artful part of the design, then finish with detailed analysis of each screen of activity and a wireframe (storyboard) of the whole user path through the application. \r\n\r\n### User Interface Design\r\n\r\n![alt tag](http://i.hizliresim.com/RYbZoG.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project is made possible by Mert Inan (@merterm), Ertuğrul Akay (@kaxell), Imge Gökalp (@energuella).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nAny suggestions or advice?
