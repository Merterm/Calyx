{"name":"Calyx","tagline":"Organize Group Projects Easily","body":"### Welcome to Calyx.\r\n\r\nCalyx features a virtual Tree in which topics can be created for educational purposes, or professional projects. Groups are formed under these topics, and each group is assigned a different task or sub-topic by the group creator. When a user enters the \"Tree\", options like entering a group, or seeing other groups' activities or uploads are possible. It also features a scheduler that helps the group to organize their time and changes its color when the work is done. In order to achieve the best user experience, we have designed an easily-accessible and organized layout for the app. The best option for the user interface design was chosen to be Material Design by Google, for its simplicity and modern form. In this readme, we first start with the presentation of the general user interface features of the design, starting with the main facilities' designs, then continuing with more detailed analysis of specific components that make the artful part of the design, then finish with detailed analysis of each screen of activity and a wireframe (storyboard) of the whole user path through the application. \r\n\r\n### User Interface Design\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n![alt tag](http://i.hizliresim.com/RYbZoG.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project is made possible by Mert Inan (@merterm), Ertuğrul Akay (@kaxell), Imge Gökalp (@energuella) and Batuhan Erdoğan (@batuhane).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nAny suggestions or advice?
